## How To Test Your Code

Open `index.html` in your browser.
* If you just want to a line or two of code, you can enter and run it directly in the browser Javascript console as a REPL.
* If you want to run a longer block of code (e.g., a loop or series of conditionals), type it out in `script.js` and use `console.log` statements to see the result in the browser Javascript console.
